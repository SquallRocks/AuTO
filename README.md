AuTO - Automatic Tournament Operator

AuTO is a side project to improve tournament officiating using Challonge's APIs. This project was motivated by the need for more efficient match calling for large tournaments, as Challonge's UI makes it easy to miss matches if surrounded by a plethora of already-conducted matches. 

Currently, it allows tournament creation and showcases match data designed for tablet and other touch screen devices. AuTO also queues matches in the most efficient order possible, creating quicker tournaments.

***Current Features***

•	Tournament creation
•	Subdomain support
•	Bulk Add
•	Simple way to seed players

•	Queues matches in most efficient order
•	Each match paired with a setup number
•	Matches can be deferred until later

•	Sync with Challonge to update scores and matches

***Future Goals***

•	Create mobile companion app for players to report scores without having to contact TO
•	Alert TO when matches are taking too long (usually happens because players forget to report scores)
•	Automatically compute ELO and Power Rankings
•	Convert over to electron.io
